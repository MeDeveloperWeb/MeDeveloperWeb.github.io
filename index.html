  <h1>WHAT THE BOOK IS ABOUT </h1>

My Experiments with Truth was written by Mahatma Gandhi (Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi) during his imprisonment at Yerwada jail in Pune and was published weekly in Navajivan from 1925 to 1929. In the book, he presents experiments he conducted in his life as an attempt to follow the Truth and his various beliefs.

  <h2> Early years</h2>

Mahatma Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 at Porbandar to a religious and well-respected Vaishnava family. He was an honest child who was devoted to his parents.

Thirteen-year old Gandhi was married to Kasturbai, and in retrospect, condemns the Hindu custom of child-marriage. In high school, Gandhi was studious and shy. While narrating his life in school, Gandhi presents his views on education. He acknowledges the importance of physical training and good handwriting. He espoused making vernacular the medium of education, for it would allow students to grasp other languages easily as well.

In high school, Gandhi fell into bad company and ate meat for a brief period, visited a brothel and caused his wife several hardships. He stole, smoked, and even contemplated suicide briefly. Finally, racked by guilt, he confessed to his father and in his father’s silent forgiveness, had his first tryst with Ahimsa. When his father passed away, Gandhi was sixteen and he records shamefully his overwhelming lust during that period which distracted him from his other duties.

In Rajkot, he developed the habit of reciting Ramanama. Truth became his guiding principle.

  <h2>Life in England</h2>

Gandhi went to England to study law in 1888. Before his departure, he faced opposition of his caste-members and was made an outcaste.

In London, he was initiated into English etiquettes and customs, but became a vegetarian. His experience taught him how to manage finances and dressing carefully. After his experiments in the English society, he learnt Latin and French, and passed the London matriculation while following a simple life. He met several members of the Theosophical society and developed an appreciation for Gita.

Gandhi passed the bar on 10 June 1891, and returned home soon after.

  <h2>Experience in South Africa</h2>

On his return, Gandhi got to now of his mother’s demise. His law practice failed in both Bombay and Rajkot, and finally to escape the intrigue of Kathiawad court, he decided to take a job in South Africa with Abdulla Sheth. He expanded his social circle and was sent to Pretoria for a case.

In Magistrate court, his insistence on wearing an Indian turban caused much controversy. He experienced racism for the first time when he was thrown out of a train first-class compartment, a stage-coach and even denied board at a hotel. Gandhi learnt of the conditions of Indians in South Africa, and decided to bring reform. He successfully argued for Indians’ entry into first- and second-class train compartments. When he returned to Natal, he opposed a bill disenfranchising Indians from the Legislative assembly.

He removed his turban when he protested the denial of his application to be an advocate in the Supreme Court on account of his race, as a compromise. He established the Natal Indian congress and rallied for the cause of the indentured labourers.

In South Africa, people tried to convert him to both Christianity and Islam, which propelled him into a comparative study of the three religions, guided by a desire for self-realisation.

Three years after his arrival, Gandhi left for India to garner support for the cause in South Africa. He started Green pamphlets which attracted media attention in India and England. During his campaigning, he met Lokmanya Tilak and Gokhale. Meanwhile, he also began sanitation reform, participated in preparation for Queen Victoria’s visit and nursed his brother-in-law in his last days.

Gandhi returned to South Africa with his family and was met with fierce opposition by the Natal whites. He was beaten by a mob, which later helped turn public opinion in his favour.

He played a significant role in nursing his children and decided to home-school them, condemning the public school education for lack of self-respect and liberty. He became a brahmacharya in 1906, for he found domesticity inconsistent with public service.

  He helped the British in the Boer war, believing that emancipation was possible from within the Empire.
  
  <h2>Congress</h2>

 After the war, Gandhi returned to India and set out to eradicate untouchability while continuing sanider Gokhale, worked to understand the Bengali community while advocating for the South African cause. He went around the country, understanding the religious structures and then set up his legal practice again. Gandhi was soon called back to South Africa for Chamberlain’s visit.

  <h2>Trouble in Transvaal</h2>

The newly formed Asiatic department in Transvaal excluded him from the deputation, and in response, Gandhi joined the Transvaal Supreme Court. He collected evidence against the guilty officials, and in his fight followed the principles of ahimsa. Gandhi’s religious consciousness continued to grow in his association with the Theosophical society. He treated everyone equally, opening his house and office to all.

Gandhi writes of his dislike of allopathy, preferring alternative treatments and home remedies.

  <h2>Satyagraha in South Africa</h2>

Gandhi saw that in Johannesburg, Indians lived like untouchables in ghettoes, and fought for their rights and welfare during the plague. He explains the actions that led to the Pheonix settlement of 1904 that accompanied the launch of Indian Opinion. Gandhi wrote for it regularly till 1914. ]

Gandhi, then loyal to the Empire, formed the Indian Ambulance Corps during the Zulu rebellion. However, he soon began to question the ‘rebellion’ as he saw horrors of war.

The principles of Satyagraha took root, and were finally named so. The public movement that defined the remainder of his stay in South Africa, was accompanied by mastering his palate through restricted diets and fasting.

Gandhi was imprisoned for the first time in 1908, and the experience combined with his wife’s illness taught him to adopt a saltless and pulseless diet. He inspired others to live similarly and a culture of fasting and restraint grew amongst the Satyagrahis at Tolstoy Farm.

  <h2>War effort</h2>

In 1914, he went to London and enlisted in the war which caused people to question his ahimsa. In the military, he led a Satyagraha for the Indians’ self-respect. He suffered from pleurisy and returned to India after his treatment.

  <h2>Satyagraha</h2>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Marche_sel.jpg/250px-Marche_sel.jpg" alt="oops" id="img">
During his time with Gokhale, he rallied against Viramgam custom cordon, and this marked the beginning of Satyagraha in India. During the description of his journey to meet his family at Shantiniketan, he highlighted the problems faced by third-class passengers in trains.

He attended the Kumbh Mela of 1915 and visited Mahatma Munshiramji’s ashram at Hrishikesh. He was disappointed by the hypocrisy of Hinduism in the two cities.

Satyagraha Ashram was established on 25 May 1915 in Ahmedabad which became the centre for revival of the cottage industry. The ashram was open to all, including untouchables.

Gandhi described his role in movements like the abolition of indenture system and his decisive presence in the Civil Disobedience movement in Champaran. He inspired strikes in other districts as well, including the Mill Worker’s strike in Ahmedabad and Kheda Satyagraha.

Meanwhile, he also rallied for the release of the Ali brothers of the Muslim League and worked for Hindu-Muslim unity. He also participated in the recruiting campaign for the First World War in India.

In the agitation against the Rowlatt Bill, a nationwide hartal was organised on 6 April 1919. However, violence erupted in many parts of the country and Gandhi suspended the mass-Satyagraha. He realised that it was premature and a miscalculation.

The publication of The Bombay Chronicle was suppressed briefly, while Young India in English and Navajivan in Gujarati took shape.

He travelled to Punjab to meet prominent leaders and decided to make it the centre for Khadi work. He also opposed the clubbing of the Khilafat question and cow protection issue, and began the Swadeshi movement. The book details proceedings of several conferences that discussed Hindu-Muslim unity and future of the non-cooperation movement. Gandhi also details the Congress politics along with instances of his disagreement with Tilak and other leaders. Gandhi described the difficulties that arose in switching to Indian-spun yarn, including acquisition of charkha, learning of skills as well as opposition from Indian mill-workers.

He explains how the non-cooperation movement was expanded to demand Swaraj at the conference in Nagpur in 1921. Gandhi concludes with a reaffirmation of his faith in Truth.

  <h2>THREE EXPERIMENTS FROM GANDHI'S LIFE</h2>

  <h3>Become a Vegetarian</h3>

Gandhi was an avowed vegetarian and gave up milk. He fasted frequently and had a restricted diet which he believed to be the source of his strength and purity.

  <h3>Converting to Brahmacharya</h3>

He emphasised this learned self-restraint as foundational to his pursuit of Truth.

  <h3>Satyagraha</h3>

Satyagraha was based on principles of non-violence, self-restraint, and respect – all of which he had adopted in his personal life already. It literally translated to ‘firmness of truth’ and was coined by Gandhi’s nephew, Maganlal.
